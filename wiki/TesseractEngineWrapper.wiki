*The current version supported to extract locations of detected characters. Also, you can run parallel for a set of images.*

Below is a quick tutorial:

1.
Download all files at: *https://tesseractdotnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dotnetwrapper/TesseractEngineWrapper

    Merge downloaded files with your source code. *You can also do copy and override, if you make sure that your source code version is 3.01 r552.*



2.
Add two new files (*tesseractenginewrapper.h* and *tesseractenginewrapper*) to *tesseract* project (*http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/)



3.
Changed the project settings as belows:

    Configuration Type: *Dynamic Library (.dll)*

    Common Language Runtime Support: *Old Syntax (/clr:oldSyntax)*

    Output File: *tesseractengine3.dll*

    Also need to add *System, System.Drawing* assembly to *Common Properties\Framework and References*

4.
After that, apply building the project.
